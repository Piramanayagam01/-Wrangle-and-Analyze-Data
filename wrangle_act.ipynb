    "The goal of this project is to wrangle the WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analyses and visualizations. Data wrangling is a core skill that everyone who works with data should be familiar with since so much of the world's data isn't clean. If we analyze, visualize, or model our data before we wrangle it, our consequences could be making mistakes, missing out on insights, and wasting time.\n",

    "The dataset that we will be wrangling is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs."
